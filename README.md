## **Turtle Graphics Simulator**  

This project implements a **Turtle Graphics simulator** in **Haskell**. The task is to help **Donatello place a pizza** using the **turtle's movement** in a **grid-based system** controlled by a set of commands. The commands allow the turtle to **move, turn, repeat actions, wait, and perform sequential actions**.  

## **Features**  
### **Turtle Movement**  
- The turtle can **move one step** in its current direction or **turn 45 degrees clockwise**.  

### **Command System**  
The simulator processes a variety of commands, including:  
- **Do** – Executes a **single action** (either **move** or **turn**).  
- **Repeat** – **Repeats** a given action a specified number of times.  
- **Wait** – The turtle **does nothing**, maintaining its position and orientation.  
- **Seq** – **Combines two commands** and executes them sequentially.  

### **Position Tracking**  
- The turtle’s **position** is represented by **Cartesian coordinates (x, y)**.  
- Its **orientation** is tracked using one of the four **cardinal directions** (**North, South, East, West**).
