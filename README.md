# Turtle

This project implements a Turtle Graphics simulator in Haskell. The task is to help Donatello place a pizza using the turtle's movement in a grid based on a set of commands. The commands allow the turtle to move, turn, repeat actions, wait, and perform sequential actions.

Features:
Turtle Movement: The turtle can move one step in its current direction or turn 45 degrees clockwise.
Command System: The simulator processes a variety of commands, including:
  Do: Executes a single action (either move or turn).
  Repeat: Repeats a given action a specified number of times.
  Wait: The turtle does nothing, maintaining its position and orientation.
  Seq: Combines two commands and executes them sequentially.
  Position Tracking: The turtle’s position is represented by Cartesian coordinates (x, y) and its orientation is tracked using                      one of the four cardinal directions (North, South, East, West).
